#CONDITIONAL EXPRESSION
# A conditional expression is a way to evaluate a condition and return one of two values based on the result.
# It is often used as a shorthand for an if-else statement.

# Example usage:
x = 5
y = 10

# Using a conditional expression
result = "Yes" if x < y else "No"
print(result)  # Yes
